# P4 - Cell Nuclei Detection via Semantic Segmentation
 Semantic segmentation for Cell Nuclei Detection using U-Net
<h1> 1. Project Summary </h1>
<p>
This project is carried out to implement Deep Learning for Model Training for Semantic Segmentation via U-Net. The objective of this project is to train a model that be able to detect cell nuclei in bidomedical images and since that the cells are usually varies in shape and sizes, semantic segmentation is the best method to implement. U-net has been a generic solution for quantification tasks such as cell detection and shape measurements in biomedical image data accoriding to Falk, T., Mai, D., Bensch, R. et al. U-Net: deep learning for cell counting, detection, and morphometry. Nat Methods 16, 67â€“70 (2019) [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30559429/).

<h1> 2. IDE and Framework </h1>
<p>
The project is built with Google Colab Notebook as the main IDE. The main frameworks used in this project are TensorFlow, Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV and Scikit-learn.

<h1> 3. Methodology </h1>
<p> 
The methodolgy of this project is inpired by Tensorflow Image Segmentation Tutorial. You can find the documentation in [link text](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation).

<h2> 3.1 Input Pipeline </h2>
<p> 
The dataset files contains a train folder for training data and test folder for testing data, in the format of images for inputs and image masks for the labels. The input images are preprocessed with feature scaling. The labels are preprocessed such that the values are in binary of 0 and 1. No data augmentation is applied for the dataset. The train data is split into train-validation sets, with a ratio of 80:20
